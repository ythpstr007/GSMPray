## Setup (About 15 Minutes)

You will need a free [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account. Cloudflare hosts the app and stores your data for free.

### Step 1 — Fork this repo

Click **Fork** in the top right of this GitHub page to create your own copy. You'll need to sign up for a free GitHub account.

### Step 2 — Create a Cloudflare KV namespace

This is where your roster data will be stored.

1. Log into [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (Create a free Cloudflare account if you don't already have one)
2. In the left sidebar click **Storage & Databases → KV**
3. Click **Create namespace**
4. Name it `LETSPRAY_KV` and click **Add**

### Step 3 — Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. In Cloudflare dashboard click **Workers & Pages → Create**
2. Choose **Pages** → **Connect to Git**
3. Select your forked repository
4. Set the build settings:
   - **Framework preset:** None
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
5. Click **Save and Deploy**

Wait for the first build to complete (about 1 minute).

### Step 4 — Bind your KV namespace

1. Go to your new Pages project → **Settings → Bindings**
2. Click **Add** → **KV Namespace**
3. Set variable name: `INTERCEDE_KV`
4. Select your `LETSPRAY_KV` namespace from the dropdown
5. Click **Save**
6. Go to **Deployments** and click **Retry deployment** (needed for the binding to take effect)

### Step 5 — Open your app and complete setup

Your app is now live at a URL like `your-project.pages.dev`.

When you open it for the first time you'll see a setup screen. Enter:
- Your **ministry name** (e.g. "First Baptist Students")
- An optional **subtitle** (e.g. "Let's Pray" or leave blank)
- An **admin password** — this protects the People, Report, and Import tabs

That's it. Start adding your people.

## Using the App

### Adding People

Go to the **People** tab (requires admin login — tap "admin" at the bottom of the screen and enter your password).

You can add people one at a time using the form at the top, or import a whole roster using the **Import** tab.

**Importing from CSV:** Your CSV needs at least a first name and last name column. Birthdays can be in MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD, or month name formats. The app will auto-detect the columns.

### Praying

Open the **Pray** tab. Swipe through cards or use the arrows. Tap **Mark as Prayed** when you've prayed for someone. The list resets every Monday at midnight Eastern Time.

### Admin Access

Tap the small **admin** link at the bottom of the screen and enter your password. This unlocks the People, Report, and Import tabs. Your session lasts 24 hours.

To lock the admin view, tap **lock admin** at the bottom.
